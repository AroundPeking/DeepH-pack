# OpenMX
Install [OpenMX package](http://www.openmx-square.org/download.html) for density functional theory Hamiltonian matrix calculation to construct datasets.

# 'overlap only' OpenMX
A modified OpenMX package is also used to compute overlap matrices only for large-scale materials structure. Install 'overlap only' OpenMX according to the *readme* document in this [repository](https://github.com/mzjb/overlap-only-OpenMX).
